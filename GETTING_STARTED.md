```

Or simply double-click `AruLifts.xcodeproj` in Finder.

In Xcode:

3. Make sure "AruLifts" is selected as the target

### 3. Build and Run

## First Time Using the App

### Initial Setup

When you first launch AruLifts:

1. **Home Screen**: You'll see your next workout preview (Workout A)
2. **Default Weights**: Starting weights are pre-configured:
   - Squat: 45 lbs (empty bar)
   - Bench Press: 45 lbs
   - Overhead Press: 45 lbs
   - Barbell Row: 65 lbs
   - Deadlift: 95 lbs

### Your First Workout

1. **Tap "Start Workout"** on the home screen
2. **Warm-up Sets**: Complete the orange-labeled warm-up sets first
3. **Working Sets**: Progress to your 5×5 working sets
4. **Log Each Set**:
   - Adjust weight if needed
   - Enter reps completed
   - Tap the ✓ to mark set as complete
5. **Rest Timer**: Automatically suggested between sets
6. **Move Between Exercises**: Use the exercise tabs or navigation buttons

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I can't complete all 5 reps?
**A:** No problem! The app will keep the same weight for your next workout. Try to get all reps next time.

### Q: What if the weights are too easy?
**A:** You can manually adjust your starting weights in Settings. Tap on any exercise weight to modify it.

### Q: Should I do the warm-up sets?
**A:** Yes! Warm-up sets prepare your muscles and nervous system, reducing injury risk.

### Q: Can I add my own exercises?
**A:** Currently, the app focuses on the core 5×5 program. Custom exercises are planned for a future update!

### Q: What about diet and nutrition?
**A:** While AruLifts focuses on training, remember that nutrition is crucial. Eat in a slight calorie surplus with adequate protein to build strength.
